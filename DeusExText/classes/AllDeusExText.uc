However, the Arcbot's big brother, the Model 5, is almost exclusively used for riot control..."

He remembered them clearly and in order as mere delusions of the nerves -- how the fear of the Professor had been the fear of the tyrannic accidents of nightmare, and how the fear of the Doctor had been the fear of the airless vacuum of science.  The first was the old fear that any miracle might happen, the second the more hopeless modern fear that no miracle can ever happen.  But he saw that these fears were fancies, for he found himself in the presence of the great fact of the fear of death, with its coarse and pitiless common sense.  He felt like a man who had dreamed all night of falling over precipices, and had woke up on the morning when he was to be hanged.  For as soon as he had seen the sunlight run down the channel of his foe's foreshortened blade, and as soon as he had felt the two tongues of steel touch, vibrating like two living things, he knew that his enemy was a terrible fighter, and that probably his last hour had come."

We believe that with sufficient research investment, the careful cultivation of acquired tissue samples from known H type epsilon negative individuals could yield an indefinite number of specimens with the immunity factors required to tolerate the injection of nano-organic material.  If you examine the attached studies, you will see that repeated cloning from the primary source material will result in only a 0.53% immunoglobin variance."

These cloned siblings would provide the necessary redundancy for further experimental trials.  In the future, this process could be streamlined through the application of accelerated growth and memory implantation."
